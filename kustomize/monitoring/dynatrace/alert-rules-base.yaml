# Standard Dynatrace Alert Rules
# These are base alert rules applied to all services

# Alert Rules (configured in Dynatrace ConfigMap):
# 1. ErrorRateAnomaly - Anomaly detection on error rate
# 2. HighLatencyAnomaly - Anomaly detection on response time
# 3. DatabaseSlowQueries - Slow database query detection
# 4. ServiceCrash - Service crash detection

# Custom alert rules can be added via:
# - Service-specific custom metrics (from metrics-catalog)
# - Environment-specific overrides (in monitoring-profiles.yaml)
