Cost management is seamlessly integrated into Platform-Next through automated labeling, real-time tracking, and intelligent optimization. When a service is onboarded via Backstage, developers select a T-shirt size (small/medium/large/xlarge) and set a monthly budget, which automatically injects cost labels (team, service, environment, cost-center, business-unit) into all Kubernetes resources via Kustomize. OpenCost, deployed in each cluster, continuously scrapes Prometheus metrics and calculates granular costs using these labels, storing time-series data in TimescaleDB. A Cost Aggregation Service polls OpenCost every 15 minutes to aggregate costs across multiple dimensions (per-service, per-team, per-environment, per-region), runs ML-based forecasting using Prophet, and detects anomalies or optimization opportunities. Developers see real-time costs, budget status, and AI-powered right-sizing recommendations directly in Backstage service pages, while Teams notifications alert them when budgets are exceeded or optimization opportunities exist. The system enables complete FinOps capabilities—chargeback to teams, budget enforcement via OPA policies, and automatic optimization (opt-in)—delivering an estimated 20-30% infrastructure cost reduction ($500K-$700K annually) while providing 100% cost visibility across the platform. This transforms cost management from a post-hoc finance exercise into a real-time, developer-visible, continuously-optimized part of the service lifecycle.
